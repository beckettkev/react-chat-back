## Introduction

This app was initially based off the template provided by facebook [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/template/README.md) and it uses some of the socket.io approaches found on the 
socket.io chat [example](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/).

react-chat-back is an experiment to see how we can work locally with web sockets in development and switch to Signalr to run the production functionality. The front-end makes use of Microsofts Fabric UI framework wherever possible.

I am always open to [your feedback](https://github.com/beckettkev/react-chat-back/issues).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## How To...

### Install a Dependency

The generated project includes React and ReactDOM as dependencies. It also includes a set of scripts used by Create React App as a development dependency. You may install other dependencies (for example, React Router) with `npm`:

```
npm install --save <library-name>
```
